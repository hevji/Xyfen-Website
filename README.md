## ⚡ How It Works

XYFEN primarily uses **`aria2`** for fast segmented downloads. If `aria2` is not available or fails, it automatically falls back to **`yt-dlp`**. You can also manually choose to use `yt-dlp` only.

1. Paste a video URL into the download field.
2. Choose your desired format and quality.
3. Click **Download**.
4. Track progress in the **Downloading** tab.
5. Completed downloads appear in **Finished**. Failed downloads appear in **Failed**.
